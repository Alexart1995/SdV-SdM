# SEA:ME with MBition


# Overview

SEA:ME is an open education curriculum program focused on automotive and mobility software engineering. The program is designed to provide hands-on, project-based learning opportunities for the next generation of automotive software engineers.

The collaboration between SEA:ME and MBition could aim to bring the latest developments in the automotive and mobility sector to the education sector by introducing a range of exciting projects and initiatives to the SEA:ME curriculum. This partnership will help bridge the gap between industry and academia, enabling students to gain practical, hands-on experience with cutting-edge technologies and tools used in the automotive industry.

MBition's expertise in developing next-generation Mercedes user experience features and technologies, re-defining software integration processes in DevOps, and building the MBOS (Mercedes Benz Operating System) platform will be invaluable in helping SEA:ME develop educational projects that provide students with practical, real-world experience.

Together, SEA:ME and MBition will focus on a range of work streams that will include developing software-defined vehicles, building new user experience features, re-defining software integration processes, and exploring the potential of the MBOS platform. Through this collaboration, students will learn the latest technologies, tools, and techniques used in the industry and gain hands-on experience with the latest developments in the field.


# Potential work areas



1. MBUX (Mercedes-Benz User Experience) development and customization: Students can learn how to develop and customize the next-generation MBUX features and functionalities, including **voice assistants, gesture controls, and augmented reality interfaces**.
2. Software integration process in DevOps: Students can learn about MBition's software integration process and participate in the development of new features using agile methodologies and **DevOps** tools. They can also work on continuous integration and delivery processes to ensure a seamless integration of software components.
3. MBOS (Mercedes-Benz Operating System) development: Students can learn about **MBOS and its architecture**, and participate in the development of MBOS-based applications using C++, QNX, and Linux. They can also work on building software modules for MBOS, such as communication, multimedia, and navigation.
4. Software-defined vehicle: Students can learn about the software-defined vehicle concept and participate in the development of software modules for vehicle control, including steering, braking, and acceleration systems. They can also work on the development of in-vehicle network protocols, such as CAN, Ethernet, and FlexRay.
5. Cybersecurity and safety: Students can learn about the cybersecurity and safety challenges associated with connected vehicles and participate in the development of security and safety features for MBOS-based vehicles. They can also work on the development of** intrusion detection and prevention systems**, secure communication protocols, and **safety-critical software components**.


# Potential educational projects & requirements



1. **Voice assistants, gesture controls and augmented reality interfaces to car**:
    1. Develop and integrate voice assistant systems (e.g. Amazon Alexa, Google Assistant) with the car's infotainment system, allowing drivers to control various functions with their voice.
    2. Develop a gesture control interface that uses sensors and cameras to detect and interpret hand movements.
    3. Develop an augmented reality interface that uses the car's windshield or heads-up display to overlay information such as navigation, speed, and vehicle diagnostics onto the driver's view.
2. **Re-defining DevOps for next generation software integration & delivery process**:
    4. Develop and implement a DevOps process that incorporates agile development methodologies, continuous integration and delivery, and automated testing to improve software quality and speed up release cycles.
    5. Develop and implement tools for monitoring and logging to provide real-time visibility into software performance and enable rapid response to issues.
3. **Software defined vehicle modules like steering, braking & acceleration systems**:
    6. Develop software for steering, braking, and acceleration systems that provides improved performance and responsiveness.
    7. Implement advanced control algorithms to enable features such as adaptive cruise control, lane keeping assist, and collision avoidance.
    8. Develop and implement testing frameworks to ensure the safety and reliability of the software.
4. **Intrusion detection and prevention systems**:
    9. Develop and implement intrusion detection and prevention systems to protect the car's software from unauthorized access and attacks.
    10. Implement secure boot processes and software updates to ensure that only trusted software is running on the car's systems.
    11. Develop and implement a security testing framework to identify vulnerabilities in the car's software.
5. **Safety-critical software components**:
    12. Develop and implement software for safety-critical components such as airbag systems, anti-lock brakes, and stability control.
    13. Implement rigorous testing and validation processes to ensure the software meets safety standards and regulations.
    14. Develop and implement fail-safe mechanisms to ensure the car's systems can still function in the event of a software failure.
